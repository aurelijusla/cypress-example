# cypress-example
Cypress example task.

## How to setup the project:
1. Node.js ([link](https://nodejs.org/en/)) and Git ([link](https://git-scm.com/)) should be installed as a prerequisite to run the test suite.
2. Clone the repo locally to your machine via the following command `git clone https://github.com/aurelijusla/cypress-example.git`.
3. Open the project root folder in any code editor (*e. g. Visual Studio Code*).
4. In terminal run `npm install` to automatically install any other project dependencies. Now you should be ready to run the tests!

## How to run the tests:
1. After setting up the project, you will be able to run the tests in two ways: using visual test runner and in headless mode.
2. To run using visual test runner use `npm run cypress:open` and wait until Cypress spec GUI is loaded. Then click **Run all specs** in top right corner.
3. To run tests in headless mode use `npm run cypress:run` command.
