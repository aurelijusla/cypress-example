2. Clone the repo locally to your machine via the following command `git clone https://github.com/aurelijusla/skycop-qa-engineer-task.git`
  OR you can download the project manually using [this link](https://github.com/aurelijusla/skycop-qa-engineer-task/archive/master.zip).
3. Open the project root folder **skycop-qa-engineer-task** in any code editor (*e. g. Visual Studio Code*).
4. In terminal run `npm install` to automatically install any other project dependencies. Now you should be ready to run the tests!

## How to run the tests:
1. After setting up the project, you will be able to run the tests in two ways: using visual test runner and in headless mode.
2. To run using visual test runner use `npm run cypress:open` and wait until Cypress spec GUI is loaded. Then click **Run all specs** in top right corner.
